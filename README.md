# Movie Recommendation Engine

This is a movie recommendation engine built using Python( alongwith its numpy and pandas library), streamlit, nltk library, sklearn. 

I have used cosine similarity for vectorization and to compare various movies on the basis of its overview, cast, crew, genre, keywords.

This engine takes a input movie from user and returns the tilte and poster of five similar movies.
